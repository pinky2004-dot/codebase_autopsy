# Codebase Autopsy Agent üë®‚Äç‚öïÔ∏è

An AI-powered agent that acts as an expert developer, allowing you to diagnose bugs and ask natural language questions about any public GitHub repository. This project was built for the **TiDB AgentX Hackathon 2025**.

## ## The Problem

Understanding and debugging large, unfamiliar codebases is a significant challenge for developers. It can take hours or even days to trace the source of a bug or understand how a specific feature is implemented, leading to major productivity losses.

## ## The Solution

The **Codebase Autopsy Agent** solves this problem by connecting to any public repository, ingesting its code into a **TiDB Serverless vector database**, and using a multi-step, agentic AI workflow to provide deep, contextual insights. It shifts the burden of code comprehension from the developer to the AI.

## ## Key Features

* **üíª On-Demand Repository Ingestion:** Load any public GitHub repository via its URL. The agent automatically handles different default branches (`main` or `master`).
* **üêû AI-Powered Bug Diagnosis:** Paste a complex error message, and the agent performs a vector search on the codebase in TiDB to find relevant code, analyze the root cause, and suggest a concrete fix.
* **ü§î "Ask Your Codebase" Q&A:** Ask high-level, natural language questions (e.g., "How does user authentication work?") and receive detailed explanations with relevant code snippets.
* **üöÄ Automated GitHub Issue Creation:** With one click, the agent can take its full analysis and automatically create a well-formatted issue in the target repository using the GitHub API.
